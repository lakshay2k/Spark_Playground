# Transformations in RDD 

***Transformations can be defined as the functions that produces new RDDs from the existing RDDs. It takes RDD as input and produces one or more RDDs as outputs. Each time it crates new RDDs when we perform any transformations. They are two types: Narrow Transformations (Map, FlatMap, Filter, Sample, Union) and Wide Transformations(reduceByKey, groupByKey, Intersection, Distinct, Join, repartition, Coalesce).***
